<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is an e-commerce built with the purpose of training my Angular and Java spring Boot learnings. 

The idea behind the website is a business that provides healthy meals, which have an amazing taste. The presentation of the meals tries to convince the viewer that his only option is to give it a try. 

### Built With

The website is built using the following technologies: 
* [Angular](https://angular.io)
* [Java Spring](https://spring.io)
* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/3)
* [MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/angular)
